Experiment data for the mixing layer case:
H. W. Liepmann and J. Laufer (1947) "Investigation of Free Turbulent
Mixing," NACA Technical Note No. 1257.

# Using the Code:
To run the CFD code, run the main.m file. Once the simulation is finished, run the postproc.m for post processing the simulation results.
